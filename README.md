# Car price predicton using Machine Learning

### Data Collection:

Gather a dataset of car information, including attributes like make, model, year, mileage, condition, number of owners, features, and prices.
Ensure the dataset contains a diverse range of cars to capture different makes, models, and price ranges.

### Data Preprocessing:

Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing the data format.
Transform categorical variables into numerical representations.
Normalize numerical variables to bring them to a similar scale.

### Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features from the dataset that can influence car prices.
Consider factors like age of the car, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and additional features.
Create new features if necessary, such as calculating the average annual mileage or the ratio of engine power to car weight.

### Splitting the Dataset:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the prediction model accurately.


### Model Selection:

Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for car price prediction.
Regression algorithms like linear regression and Lasso regression are commonly used for this task.

### Training and Evaluation:

Train the selected model using the training dataset.
